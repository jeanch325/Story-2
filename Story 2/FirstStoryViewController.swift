You're using the last of your battery to find your way to the nearest public area. Suddenly, a white van drives up behind you. The man in the driver's seat lowers the window and yells at you to get in. You look and see that he has a knife in his left hand. Do you:"

He notices this and then tells you that he picked you up to help him dispose of the body. Once you get to the location - a field - , he gets out of the car and carries the body and a shovel to an empty plot of grass."

    let story6 : String = "Burdened by the weight of both the body and the shovel, he is unable to catch you. You make it out alive and never hear of the man and the body again."
